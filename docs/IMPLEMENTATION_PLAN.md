# MCM/ICM Agent Implementation Plan

Status date: 2026-06-15

This plan reflects the current repository at `/Users/mac/Programming/MCM-ICM-Agent`.
The earlier `MathModelAgentDesign/reference_implementation/` layout has been superseded:
the implementation now lives at the repository root.

For current implementation status, see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

## 0. Current Baseline

The repository already contains a tested MVP with:

- CLI-first Python package under `src/mcm_agent/`.
- Workspace, artifact registry, event log, handoff packets, workflow topology, and stage executor.
- Provider adapters for LLM, MinerU, Tavily, Firecrawl, Brave, Exa, UShallPass, LaTeX, academic APIs, and official data APIs.
- Core agents for intake, extraction, problem understanding, data feasibility, discussion, reframing, modeling, search, RAG, EDA, solver, validation, visualization, claim planning, writing, compliance, review, revision, reference management, and submission packaging.
- Source governance through `source_registry.json`, `retrieval_log.jsonl`, `data_lineage.json`, and `citation_candidates.json`.
- Modeling evidence through `experiment_runs.jsonl`, `model_metrics.json`, `model_route_summary.json`, and `evidence_registry.json`.
- Vector-first figure planning and figure QA.
- Claim planning through `paper/claim_plan.json`.
- Paper evidence binding at section level, claim level, and planned-claim coverage level.
- Fake-provider end-to-end workflow tests.

Latest verified baseline:

```bash
pytest -q
# 266 passed

ruff check src tests scripts
# All checks passed
```

Runtime workspaces are created outside the source tree and contain task artifacts such as
`data/`, `results/`, `figures/`, `paper/`, `review/`, and `final_submission/`.

## 2. Configuration Contract

`mcm_agent_config.example.json` is the preferred public runtime configuration contract.
Copy it to `mcm_agent_config.local.json`, fill only the providers you want to use, and pass
it with `--config-file`. The local JSON file is ignored by git and may contain plaintext
API keys for local use.

```bash
cp mcm_agent_config.example.json mcm_agent_config.local.json
mcm-agent provider-status --config-file mcm_agent_config.local.json
```

The config sections are `llm`, `search`, `official_data`, `mineru`, `humanizer`, `rag`,
and `runtime`. `.env.example` and `--env-file` remain backward compatible, but JSON values
override env-file values when both are supplied.

Rules:

- Do not commit `.env`, `mcm_agent_config.local.json`, or real secrets.
- Do not commit user-filled `knowledge_base/*`; only `knowledge_base/.gitkeep` is tracked.
- Unit tests must use fake providers or HTTP mocks.
- Live provider checks belong in explicit smoke commands.
- MCP is optional for local development and is not a core runtime dependency.

## 4. Active Next Phase

The active next phase is **Automatic LaTeX Repair**.

Purpose:

The system now stores sources, data lineage, evidence, figures, references, claim plans,
contextual paper sections, claim-level paper bindings, paper-quality scores, hybrid route
plans, route-aware experiment specs, solver blueprints, route execution status,
official-data repair records, and provenance-aware local RAG entries across the main
provider families. The system also runs deterministic solver recipes for evaluation,
optimization, forecasting, simulation, classification, clustering, queueing, and network
tasks, plus deterministic typesetting QA and first-class provider smoke checks. The
system also generates artifact-derived methodology and claim-evidence concept diagrams
as Mermaid source plus SVG vector outputs. Source-backed claim writing now maps
`source_id` values to BibTeX keys and records citation keys in evidence bindings. The
remaining work is to make LaTeX repair and user interaction more adaptive.

Current core artifact:

```text
results/model_route_summary.json
reports/model_candidates.md
paper/claim_plan.json
figures/figure_registry.json
figures/source/*.mmd
paper/references.bib
review/paper_evidence_bindings.json
review/typesetting_quality.json
```

Current implemented flow:

```text
problem diagnosis + data/RAG context
        ↓
model route plan + evidence constraints
        ↓
solver/figure/paper generation
        ↓
typesetting QA + final gate
        ↓
submission package
```

## 5. Next Phase Tasks

### Task 1: Automatic LaTeX Repair

Target behavior:

- Move beyond detection/routing into targeted source rewrites for tables, equations,
  float placement, and common compile failures.
- Keep repair attempts traceable through review artifacts.

## 6. Later Build Phases

After routes H, I, and J, continue with these quality phases:

1. **Smoother Interactive Checkpoints**
   - Add user-friendly checkpoint review and decision capture beyond file-oriented CLI
     checkpoints.

2. **Live Provider History**
   - Persist smoke histories, cost estimates, and rate-limit notes for contest-day
     readiness.

## 7. Operating Rules

- Use TDD for behavior changes.
- Keep commits small and independently useful.
- Do not call paid or live APIs in unit tests.
- Never commit `.env`, `mcm_agent_config.local.json`, or secrets.
- Every external datum needs a `source_id`.
- Every modeled result needs an `evidence_id`.
- Every final data figure needs a `figure_id`, source data, and PDF/SVG output.
- Every important paper claim should either bind to evidence, figures, and sources, or be explicitly unresolved.
- Every blocking review finding must map to a repair stage.

## 8. Verification Before Completion

For documentation-only changes:

```bash
pytest tests/test_docs.py -q
```

For code changes:

```bash
pytest -q
ruff check src tests scripts
```

Before pushing a phase, confirm `git status --short` only contains intended files.
